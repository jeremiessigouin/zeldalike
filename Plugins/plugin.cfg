name="FBX Batch Conversion"
description="This plugin is intended for bulk importing static single-material FBX files such as those released by SyntyStore. It can import all FBX files in a folder as TSCN files with only the mesh, and apply a single material to them, before spitting them out in a destination directory. It can use an existing material or create a new one.

Note: I have only tested on Synty assets with single albedo textures. The normal map and other items have not yet been tested, which is why this is not yet 1.0."
